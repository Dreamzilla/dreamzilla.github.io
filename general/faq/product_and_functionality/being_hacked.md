## I believe I’m being hacked, can I use Serverauditor to see who’s on my network?
The short answer is No.

Serverauditor can be used to login to remote computers such as a server, a router, a Raspberry Pi, or any other node, to interact with remote shell. It's a classic SSH client for server administrators or network developers, like PuTTY for instance.

It does not login into devices or servers that weren't set up for such purpose. Neither can it extract detailed event logs or histories from networks that you are not authorized to.
