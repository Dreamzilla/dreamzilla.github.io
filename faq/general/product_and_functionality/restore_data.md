## I’ve reset my password and now I’ve lost all my data. Is there a way to restore it?
Unfortunately, there is no way to restore your user data after a password has been reset, due to privacy and security reasons. 

Our storage follows the ‘zero-knowledge’ principle. This means that all data is stored encrypted. Your password is being used as encryption hash. We do not store your password. When a password is reset, the encryption hash will be lost making it impossible to decipher the stored data.
