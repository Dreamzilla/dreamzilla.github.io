## How many devices can I connect?

A user subscribes only once to get access through _all_ his devices, no matter the number of devices. The Premium subscriptions support an unlimited amount of devices per user.

> *__!__* a Premium subscription supports cross-platform functionality. A premium subscription purchased on iOS does work on Android and vice versa.
